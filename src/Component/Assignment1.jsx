            <p>
              ReactJs is a javaScript library created by Facebook for creating
              dynamic and interactive application and building better UI/UX
              design for web and Mobile Application.

            <h2>What is CLI command In React Js? </h2>
            <p>
              In React.js, a CLI(Command Line Interface) command is a command
              that you run your computer's terminal or command prompt perform
              various development tasks related to building, testing, and
              deploying React applications. React provides a tool called{" "}
              <b>"Create React App" (CRA)</b> that simplifies the setup and
              development process of React applications, and it comes with a set
              of CLI commands to help you manage your project. CRA is the most
              common way to start a React project, and it abstracts away many of
              the configuration details, allowing you to focus on writing React
              code.

            <h2>What is Components in React Js? </h2>
            <p>
              In React.js, a component is a fundamental building block for
              building user interfaces. Components are reusable, self-contained
              pieces of code that encapsulate a specific piece of UI and its
              associated logic. React applications are typically composed of
              multiple components that work together to create complex user
              interfaces.

                <h3>Functional Components</h3>
                <p>
                  Functional components, also known as stateless components, are
                  defined as JavaScript functions. They take in props (short for
                  properties) as arguments and return JSX (JavaScript XML) to
                  describe the UI structure. Functional components are primarily
                  used for presenting UI elements and do not manage their own
                  state. Here's an example of a functional component:
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Class Components</h3>
                <p>Class components are defined as ES6 classes that extend the React.Component class. They have a more extensive feature set than functional components and can manage their own state using the this.state object. Class components also have access to lifecycle methods, which allow you to control component behavior at different stages of its life cycle. Here's an example of a class component:</p>

          <h2>How to change in components of React Js? </h2>
          <p>
            React Component automatically re-render whenever there is a change in their state or props.
            A simple update of the state, from anywherein the code, causes all the UserInterface(UI)
            elements to be re-render automatically.
